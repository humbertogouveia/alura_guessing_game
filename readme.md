## 🧠 How the Game Works

1. The browser asks the user to type a number between **1 and 100**.
2. If the guess is **incorrect**, the game shows a hint:
   - “The secret number is higher”
   - “The secret number is lower”
3. The user keeps trying until they guess the **secret number**.
4. When the user wins, the game shows:
   - The secret number  
   - How many attempts were needed
